A template is a mango module designed to be cloned INTO AS a new mango module.

The .on-install hook will be called when the template is cloned.

A template typically removes its .git folder in the .on-install hook, removing all history and links to the original repository. The user would choose whether to initialize a new git repository.

To build a template, source the built-in template template:

- mango @init --template template
