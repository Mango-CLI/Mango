Each .mango folder may contain any number of mango submodules, or submodules for short.

Submodules are mango modules nested in .mango/.submodules/. It is designed so that:
1. Submodules are externally maintained, so users are discouraged from modifying them directly.
2. To facilitate easier version management.

A submodule is a mango module, containing its own `.instructions` file. It must be a git repo for updating and sharing.

To reference commands from a submodule, use the syntax `module-path:command-name`.

For example, you should do:
- mango module-1:a

In order to reference a command directly from a submodule, use a export directive in the parent module's `.instructions` file.

script-e: e                     # For root-level scripts
folder/script-b: b              # And for scripts in folders too
module-1:binding-a: a           # For scripts in submodules you should re-bind to export
@export module-1                # This will export all bindings from module-1

To create your own submodule, use:

- mango init --template submodule
