Each .mango folder may contain any number of mango submodules, or submodules for short.

Submodules are mango folders nested in .mango/.submodules/. It is designed so so that:
1. Submodules are externally maintained, so users are discouraged from modifying them directly.
2. To facilitate easier version management.

A submodule is a mango folder, containing its own `.instructions` file

To reference commands from a submodule, use the syntax `module-path:command-name`.

For example, you should do:
- mango module-1:a

In order to reference a command directly from a submodule, use a export directive in the parent module's `.instructions` file.

script-e: e
module-1/script-a: a            # Exporting a single script requires users to re-bind it
@export module-1                # This will export all commands from module-1
