All hooks in Mango are CONVENTIONAL, which means that they are NOT part of any syntax, and are not special in any way.

These hooks work solely because the default home mango repo calls them whenever a host command is invoked there.

Feel free to modify, replace or add any hook if you feel that it is convenient.

default hooks:
  .on-add   Called after @add is triggered. Takes two positional arguments: the new file name, and the full path to the repo.
